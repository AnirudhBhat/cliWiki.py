This is quick weekend hack made to access Wikipedia from command line.


Its written in python.To compile it just run 'python cliwiki.py'(without quotes) from your terminal and then enter the search title to get Wikipedia page on your terminal! 


It can also be given one of following 3 command line arguments.

1)potd
2)featured
3)onthisday 

this is just a quick hack and there's lot of crappy code in it.So please feel free to fork and send pull request if u want to improve it.
